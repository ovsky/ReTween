# üì¶ ReTween - Fastest Unity and .NET Tweening Solution 

## üìí ReTween
ReTween is blazing fast, zero-garbage, modular and really simple Tweening System for Unity.


## üìñ QuickStart
### ReTween:

So, let's use the Tween!

#### Usage:

```csharp
// Position and Color
Tween.Position(transform, Vector3.right);
Tween.Color(someImage, Color.blue).SetDelay(0.5f);
```

So, it's pretty easy!

#### Extended Usage:

```csharp
// Position
Tween.Position(transform, new Vecor3(0, 5, 0), delay, duration);
Tween.Position(transform, position);
Tween.Position(transform, () => FindTarget());

// Color
Tween.Color(image, Color.blue, delay, 1.0f, Ease.InOut);
Tween.Color(image, Color.blue).SetDelay(0.5f).SetEase(EaseType.Linear);
```

#### Next:
You can create custom chain of Tweens:

```csharp
// Next Chain:
Tween.Scale(transform, Vector3.one * 3f, 1f, 0f, anotherEase)
    .Next(Tween.Scale(transform, Vector3.one * 4f))
    .Next(Tween.Wait(3f))
    .Next(Tween.Scale(transform, Vector3.one * 2f, 1f, 0f, anotherEase))
        .SetDelay(5f));
```

#### Async:
The Tween is fully asynchronous, so you can use them for yield and as enumerables:

```csharp
yield return Tween.Scale(transform, Vector3.zero, 1f, 0f, scaleEase);
yield return Tween.Position(transform, Vector3.right * 3f, 1f, 0f, anotherEase);
yield return Tween.Wait(2f);
yield return Tween.Scale(transform, Vector3.one * 3f, 1f, 0f, anotherEase);
```

#### Break:
If you want, you can apply some tween breaking rules, like BreakPoint function or BreakObject.

**Break Point** - set if you want to finish tween on reaching some function:

```csharp
// Custom Break Point
Tween.Color(someImage, Color.blue).SetBreakPoint(() => colorLoopActive && colorTarget == 1);
Tween.Position(transform, targetPosition).SetBreakPoint(() => IsTweenActive());
```

**Break Object** - set if you want to finish tween on destroy of target object:

```csharp
// Custom Break Object
Tween.Color(someImage, Color.blue).SetBreakObject(parentObject);
```

### üóÇÔ∏è ReExtensions:
ReTween supports custom extensions, like predefined: 

`ReTween.Next()` - where you can define next custom Action and TweenAction.  

`ReTween.SetEase()` - where you can define easing mode.

`ReTween.SetDelay()` - where you can define delay.

`SetAction`, `SetDuration`, `SetStartTime`, `SetBreakPoint`, `SetBreakObject` - and more.

---

### üìö ReModules:

You can create new ReModule by writing new script in ReTween/Modules that will assign new method by `Tween.Add()` and describe new `Action<float>`, where the `float` is easing time, from 0 to 1.

To follow the ReTween guidelines, you can write your new class as *partial* of the RwTween *(by Tween.YourModule())*.

Example: 
If we want to add a Color Lerp module for UI.Image, we need to write simple instruction:

```csharp
public static void Color(Image image, Color target)
{
    Tween.Add(new TweenAction((float time) => image.color = UnityEngine.Color.LerpUnclamped(image.color, target, time)));
}
```

Obviously, you can create more complex Tweens. Basic `TweenAction` is built with pre-implemented values, like: `duration`, `delay`, `easing`, like:

```csharp
public static void Color(Image image, Color target, float duration = 1f, float delay = 0f, Ease ease = null)
{
    Tween.Add(new TweenAction((float time) => image.color = UnityEngine.Color.LerpUnclamped(image.color, target, time), duration, delay, ease));
}
```

Now to tween the UI Image color, you can write in your code:
```csharp
Tween.Color(someImage, Color.blue, 0.5f, 2f);
```

### üìò Ease / Easing:

#### How easing works?

Easings are some sort of simple curves, that helps to visualise and evaluate smooth and juicy, animations. You can use some of the predefined curves or create own.

Easing Examples:

--- 

#### Technical:

*Ease* is fully compatible and swapable with Unity AnimationCurves - which with you may be already familiar.
In every field you have used AnimationCurve, you can use Ease as the replacement, without changing the implementation. 
The most important difference is that Eases has many predefined, basic values - a bank of custom definition - they are completely garbage-free and made with optimisation in-mind. 

### ‚è© Supported high-performace Ease Calculations:

**ReTween** provides implementation of 28 high-performance math patterns for easing types:

```csharp  
    Linear = 0,
    QuadIn = 1,
    QuadOut = 2,
    QuadInOut = 3,
    CubicIn = 4,
    CubicOut = 5,
    CubicInOut = 6,
    QuartIn = 7,
    QuartOut = 8,
    QuartInOut = 9,
    QuintIn = 10,
    QuintOut = 11,
    QuintInOut = 12,
    BounceIn = 13,
    BounceOut = 14,
    BounceInOut = 15,
    ElasticIn = 16,
    ElasticOut = 17,
    ElasticInOut = 18,
    SlowElasticIn  =  19,
    CircularIn  =  20,
    CircularOut  =  21,
    CircularInOut  =  22,
    SinusIn  =  23,
    SinusOut  =  24,
    SinusInOut  =  25,
    ExponentialIn  =  26,
    ExponentialOut  =  27,
    ExponentialInOut  =  28,|
    BackwardIn  =  29,
    BackwardOut  =  30,
    BackwardInOut  =  31,
    BackwardInOutHalf  =  32,
```


## üìó API Reference

#### The structure of basic *TweenAction*:

| TweenAction | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `startTime` | `float` | TweenAction start time. *[auto assigned][read-only]* |
| `action` | `Action<float>` | Main action, that receives the float value as lerp time. |
| `delay` | `float` | Time to start invoking TweenAction |
| `duration` | `float` | Duration of tweening process. |
| `breakPoint` | `Func<bool>` | Function that should be meet to break tween. |
| `breakObject` | `GameObject` | Function that should be destroyed to break tween. |

#### *Ease* base construction operators:

```csharp
EaseType, AnimationCurve, Ease
```

#### *Ease* public static methods:
```csharp
Ease SetEaseName<string>(value)
Ease GetCustom<string>(value)
Ease SetCustom<string>(value)
```
